# term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf)
# tfidf = tf x idf, idf(w, D) can be computed as the log transform of the total number of
# documents in the corpus C divided by the document frequency of the word w, 
# which is basically the frequency of documents in the corpus where the word w occurs.
